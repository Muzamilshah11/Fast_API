# ... other routes and logic would go here ...
# Likely content and explanation of main.py:
# •
# It imports FastAPI to create the application instance.
# •
# It imports SessionLocal, engine, and Base from the database.py file.
# •
# Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine) is crucial. This line creates the database tables (users and items) in your SQLite database (my_first_database.db) based on the model definitions in database.py. This is executed when the application starts.
# •
# app = FastAPI() creates an instance of the FastAPI application.
# •
# The comment "# ... other routes and logic would go here ..." indicates that this file would contain your API endpoints (paths decorated with @app.get, @app.post, etc.) and the logic for handling requests and interacting with the database using the SessionLocal. The transcript mentions that schema definitions and CRUD operation functions would likely reside in separate files in a more organized project
